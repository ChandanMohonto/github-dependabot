# **Dependabot Demo Project**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Dependabot Demo Project**! This project demonstrates how to integrate **Dependabot** in a **Node.js** application for **automated dependency management**. The application uses **Express** and **Axios** to make HTTP requests to the **GitHub API**. **Dependabot** is configured to automatically create pull requests that update dependencies whenever new versions are available. This ensures your app is always up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

## **Why Use Dependabot?**

* **Automated Dependency Updates**: **Dependabot** automatically checks for updates to your dependencies and creates pull requests to update them, saving time on manual dependency management.
* **Security**: It helps keep your project secure by automatically proposing updates for known vulnerabilities.
* **Improved Project Health**: Regular updates ensure that you’re using the latest versions of libraries, preventing compatibility issues and reducing technical debt.
* **Customizable**: You can configure **Dependabot** to run on a schedule, manage pull request limits, and set custom commit messages.

## **How to Use Dependabot**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Node.js Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChandanMohonto/github-dependabot.git
   cd github-dependabot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the app using the following command:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the GitHub API response.

### **Step 2: Set Up Dependabot**

1. **Create the `dependabot.yml` Configuration File**:
   In the root of your project, create a `.github` folder if it doesn’t already exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir .github
   touch .github/dependabot.yml
   ```

2. **Add the Following Configuration** to the `dependabot.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: "npm"
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: "daily"  # Can be "weekly", "monthly", or "daily"
       commit-message:
         prefix: "UPDATE"   # Custom commit message prefix
       open-pull-requests-limit: 5
   ```

### **Step 3: Explanation of the `dependabot.yml` File**

The `dependabot.yml` file contains the configuration that tells **Dependabot** how to manage dependency updates in your project. Here’s a breakdown of the configuration:

1. **`version`**:

   * Specifies the version of the Dependabot configuration syntax. `version: 2` is the current version.

2. **`updates`**:

   * A list of configurations for dependency updates. You can define different strategies for various ecosystems (e.g., npm, Docker, Python).

3. **`package-ecosystem`**:

   * Specifies the package manager used in the project. For this project, it’s `npm`.

4. **`directory`**:

   * Specifies the directory where the `package.json` file is located. In this case, it’s the root directory (`/`).

5. **`schedule`**:

   * Specifies how often Dependabot should check for dependency updates:

     * `daily` – Checks for updates every day.
     * `weekly` – Checks for updates once a week.
     * `monthly` – Checks for updates once a month.

6. **`commit-message`**:

   * Defines the prefix for commit messages created by Dependabot. For example, `"UPDATE: Bump express from 4.17.1 to 4.18.0"`.

7. **`open-pull-requests-limit`**:

   * Limits the number of open pull requests Dependabot can create at the same time. Here, it’s set to 5.

---

### **Step 4: Commit and Push to GitHub**

1. **Commit the Changes**:
   After creating the `dependabot.yml` file, commit the changes and push them to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .github/dependabot.yml
   git commit -m "Add Dependabot configuration"
   git push origin master
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Wait for Dependabot to Run**

* **Dependabot** will now run according to the schedule set in `dependabot.yml`. It will check for updates to your dependencies (e.g., `express`, `axios`) and create pull requests when new versions are available.

* You can view the pull requests in the **Pull Requests** section of your GitHub repository.

---

### **Step 6: Review and Merge Pull Requests**

* When **Dependabot** creates a pull request to update a dependency, review the PR, check the release notes, and test the changes.

* Once you're confident that the update is safe, merge the PR. **Dependabot** will automatically clean up the branch after merging.

## **Commit Message Customization in Dependabot**

### **Step 7: Customize Commit Message Prefixes**

Dependabot allows you to customize the commit message format it uses when creating pull requests. This is helpful to maintain consistency with your version control workflow and to categorize updates based on their nature.

#### **Explanation of Custom Commit Message Prefix**:

The **`commit-message.prefix`** field in the **`dependabot.yml`** file lets you define the prefix for commit messages in pull requests. You can set any prefix that fits your team's workflow. Here are some common examples:

* **`"UPDATE"`**: For general updates to dependencies.
* **`"FIX"`**: For minor bug fixes or patches.
* **`"CHORE"`**: For maintenance tasks like dependency updates or configuration changes (this is the default prefix).
* **`"FEATURE"`**: For major feature additions or updates.

You can use any of these prefixes or define your own naming convention depending on your project needs.

#### **Example of Commit Messages**:

1. **"UPDATE"**:
   If the prefix is set to `"UPDATE"`, Dependabot's PR commit message could look like:

   ```bash
   UPDATE: Bump express from 4.17.1 to 4.18.0
   ```

2. **"FIX"**:
   If you choose `"FIX"`, the commit message could be:

   ```bash
   FIX: Resolve security vulnerability in axios package
   ```

3. **"CHORE"**:
   If you choose `"CHORE"`, the commit message might look like:

   ```bash
   CHORE: Update configuration for new package version
   ```

4. **"FEATURE"**:
   If you select `"FEATURE"`, the commit message could be:

   ```bash
   FEATURE: Add new authentication middleware
   ```

---

### **How to Use It:**

1. **Update Your `dependabot.yml` File**:
   Change the **`commit-message.prefix`** field to any prefix that fits your team's naming convention (e.g., "UPDATE", "FIX", etc.).

2. **Commit and Push the Changes**:
   After updating the `dependabot.yml` file, commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .github/dependabot.yml
   git commit -m "Custom commit message prefix for Dependabot"
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Dependabot’s Pull Request Commit**:
   Now, when Dependabot creates a pull request, the commit message will follow your custom format, such as:

   ```bash
   UPDATE: Bump axios from 0.21.0 to 0.21.2
   ```

---

## **Conclusion**

By integrating **Dependabot** into your Node.js project, you automate the process of dependency management, ensuring your project is always up-to-date with the latest, secure, and compatible dependencies. This reduces the maintenance burden and improves the overall health of your codebase.

Let Dependabot do the heavy lifting, so you can focus on building great features!
